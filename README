 Tim's Nasty emacs configuration

The basic structure of the directories is:
  elpa: is the Emacs Lisp Package Archive http://tromey.com/elpa/
  lisp: is the packages I've installed manually before I found ELPA
  lisp-personal: are my personal configuration files. Many of which actually work.
  src: has copies of some of the source *.gz packages I used in the lisp directory.

It surely isn't a pretty mess but it's a mess I've built over 8+ years of tinkering with Emacs.
