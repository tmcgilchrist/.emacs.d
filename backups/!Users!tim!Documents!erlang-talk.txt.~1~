 Introduction to Erlang

__History__

__Gentle Introduction__

__Interesting Highlights__
Functional Features
Immutable State - Assign once variable
Actor based concurrency- different approaches to concurrency, Erlang uses no shared state.
Message passing - first class feature that is highly optimised
Runs on a virtual machine, similar to the JVM or .NET (ewww)
Exception handle - simply restart the process

Hot code replacement. You can code your application such that you load the new version of your application and when it calls a particular function it magically switches to the newere version. Any existing processes will continue to run the old version until they hit this function. !!Code Example - Demo!!

This allows for highly available software that can be upgraded in production without any system downtime (assuming there were no bugs ;-)).

OTP - Open Telecom Platform: Think of it as J2EE but for Erlang and with less wailing and nashing of teeth. !!Provides-Examples!!

__Lies and Benchmarks__
Scalability of Apache vs Yaws

YAWS - Yet Another Web Server is, as the name suggests another webserver but written in Erlang using the lightweight processes approach.

__Interesting Projects__
Wings3D - 3D flight simulator. Really doesn't belong in Erlangs target niche, lots of floating point and has a single thread.

CouchDB - Document oriented database. Features: MapReduce, Highly scalable, Replication, REST Architecture.

RabbitMQ - Message Broker. !!Needs more research!! Use instead of a traditional Java MQ.
