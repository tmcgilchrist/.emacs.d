After having some issues getting the wireless card recognised, the next issue was getting onto my home and work network.

My home network is Airport Extreme G/N using WPA2 Personal. The following configuration was placed in /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf and using wpa_cli I was finally able to connect.

<code> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
network={
        ssid="network1_ssid"
        scan_ssid=1
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        proto=RSN
        pairwise=CCMP
        psk="very secret password"
}
</code>

My work's WPA Enterprise network that uses RADIUS authentication. I believe this autheticates against a Windows Domain so the identity and password values will be that for the Windows Domain. 

<code>
network={
        ssid="network2_ssid"
        scan_ssid=1
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP IEEE8021X NONE
        proto=RSN WPA
        eap=TTLS PEAP TLS
        identity="user name"
        password="**********"
}
</code>

Problems:
 One network uses DHCP and the other doesn't. Coming from Mac OSX I was expecting some sort of location concept where I could just say I'm at home change the network setup for there. But so far I haven't found anything that does anything like that. At worst it could be a manual script that runs the right commands, but ideally it would look at the SSIDs available if one matched change to that network setup.

So apart from that small issue the network seems to be very stable and the range is as good as it was under Linux.

Useful commands:
wpa_cli status -> shows the whether or not the wireless is associated with an access point.
wpa_cli reload -> reloads the wpa_supplicant configuration file.
