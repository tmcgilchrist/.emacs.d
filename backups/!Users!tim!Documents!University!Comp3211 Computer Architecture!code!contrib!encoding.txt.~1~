        __ Instruction Encoding __

Instruction Formats (16 bit)
 1. R-Type  | Opcode | RS | RT | RD | empty |
 2. I-Type  | Opcode | RD |    Immediate    |

where: Opcode takes 4 bits
       RS, RT, RD take 3 bits
       and Immediate takes 8 bits
       
       There is enough space for a 4th register.

       _R-Type_
These operations are r-type:
 + xor $rd, $rs, $rt     : Exclusive OR
 + add $rd, $rs, $rt	 : Unsigned Addition
 + lsr $rs	         : Logical Shift Right by 4 bits
 + lsl $rs	         : Logical Shift Left by 4 bits
 + ldr $rs, $rt	         : Load Register without XOR
 + ldx $rs, $rt	         : Load Register with XOR check for 
       	    		   end or input
 + str $rs, $rt		 : Store Register rs into address rt,
       	    	      	   and reset pc


       _I-Type_
These operations are i-type:
 + li  $rd, (Immediate)  : Load Immediate

|Operation | Opcode |
---------------------
| xor      |  0000  |
| add      |  0001  |
| lsr      |  0010  |
| lsl      |  0011  |
| ldr      |  0100  |
| ldx      |  0101  |
| str      |  0110  |
| li       |  1000  |
---------------------
Note: the most significant bit will determine if it's R or I type.

        _ Register values _
We will have certain "constants" hardwired into our ALU for common operations.
We will use $r0->$r5 in our code (we only need 4 registers atm) and have the
remaining registers named $c0 and $c1 where $c0 gives access to a hardwired
constant "c" to our ALU and $c1 gives a hardwires "0x02" to our ALU for incrementing
our memory pointer using the store operation.
