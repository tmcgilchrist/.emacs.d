        RIP Notes.

- Timers
In RIP every gateway that participates in routing sends an update message to all its neighbors once every 30 seconds.

- Packet contents
- Limitations
  + Limited to networks whose longest path involves 15 hops
  + Depends on "counting to infinity" to resolve routing loops.
  + Fixed "metric" to compare alternative routes, no way to introduce policy based routing.
