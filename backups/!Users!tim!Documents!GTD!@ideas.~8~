  - dhcp_process.erl - listens on socket and spawns worker process.
  - dhcp_worker.erl  - worker process that does the processing.
  
  - setup project structure and build scripts. (DONE)
  - create skeleton code that compiles. (DONE)
  - test program that creates DHCP srequests.
  - support DNS updates

- Erlang version of routing protocol?? OSPF, BGP or ISIS.

- RSS feed reader with keywords as the organisation criteria.

3. SVN repository mirroring. Provide mult-master commits. Replicate
commits on any node to any other node.
  ?? Need to test a commit against a repository. Provide for
  rollback. Ordering of commits. 

Basic 2PC transaction, Erlang ?
Erlang port for native svn-lib interaction. 
1 Erlang node per node, communicate via sockets or Erlang VM messages.


Wan-Disco provides a proxy in front of SVN, and replays the commit
messages against all nodes. They need to implement the WebDav
protocol.

What functionality does SVN-Lib provide to do commit and rollback
