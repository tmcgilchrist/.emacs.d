    __University__
- Get "Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface"
- Need a simple compiler that generates native bytecode.
    + Simple C like language
    + Different backends for different cpus, MIPS, x86, PowerPC
    + Written using Haskell or Erlang

Erlang - Parsetools, an LALR-1 parser generator for Erlang, similar to yacc
         http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/parsetools/index.html

Haskell - Parsec, monadic parser combinator

    __Haskell__
- signup to GHC developers mailing list, ask question about removing
  warnings in GHC code. Other easy bug fixes!! Major opportunity.

- H264 encod/decode in Haskell || Erlang

    __Erlang__
- Multiple message passing.

- Fibonnaci Sequence Multi-Core with Erlang
http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/blog/2007/11/29#smoking-4core

- Erlang DTrace provider!!
see the google group.

- Assembler for Erlang Virtual Machine. Or a compiler to target it.

- eBay like auction site using erlyWeb, couchDB?

- Erlang library for calling java JMS.

- Multi-threaded find command in Erlang.
    Erlang version of find(1), multi-threaded
    Haskell version as well?

 _Erlang snippets_
code:all_loaded() you'll see which modules get loaded


    __Other__
- Flickr mapping application that compiles all pictures along a certain route.
 So you can checkout a walk and see places of interest.
