These will be fairly static and are more for storing interesting things I come across rather than for day to day use.

Collect project ideas and be able to tag them with various bits of information if they overlap with different goals or areas. Especially want a tag for each major goal area for the year, and perhaps an
other one for misc things.


What to I want to have achieved at the end of this year?

     - significant Erlang skills, be comfortable writing stuff from scratch in Erlang.
     - house and garden looking more finished with things like rooms finished and
       plants laid out in the garden.
     - regularily contributing to at least one open source project.


     The HOW!
- Keep a text file with my goals for this year.
- Keep lists and tasks in iGTD.
- Have 3 Most Important Tasks (MIT) each day.
- Review system constantly for better ways to do things.


What do I want to be doing?

- Erlang/OTP
- Haskell
- ObjectiveC/Cocoa
- Java

What are my core interests?
Remuneration?
Lifestyle?
Long term?

Only real option is continued Java investment, with a gradual switch to an alternative area. Short term, need to switch jobs which requires re-investing in Java skills.

Use OpenSource as a vehicle to doing what I want.

Side project that generates income?

Project focus rather than learn technology focus. Evaluate likely technologies befor starting the project.
