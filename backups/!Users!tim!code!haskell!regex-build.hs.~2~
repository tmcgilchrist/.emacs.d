-- Build a library that adds a class method called build() to Regexp. 
-- build() should accept a variable number of arguments which can include 
-- integers and ranges of integers. Have build() return a Regexp object 
-- that will match only integers in the set of passed arguments.

-- Problems:
-- 1. Regex construction see 
--    http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2007/02/27/a-haskell-regular-expression-tutorial/

-- 2.
