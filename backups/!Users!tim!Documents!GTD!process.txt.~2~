I would like to have a list of:
  1) books that I am planning to read,
  2) music I'm planning to get and 
  3) computer books to read including books I own and ones to purchase.

These will be fairly static and are more for storing interesting things I come across rather than for day to day use.

Collect project ideas and be able to tag them with various bits of information if they overlap with different goals or areas. Especially want a tag for each major goal area for the year, and perhaps another one for misc things.


What to I want to have achieved at the end of this year?

     - significant Erlang skills, be comfortable writing stuff from scratch in Erlang.
     - house and garden looking more finished with things like rooms finished and 
       plants laid out in the garden.
     - regularily contributing to at least one open source project.
     

     The HOW!
- Keep a text file with my goals for this year.
- Keep lists and tasks in iGTD.
- Have 3 Most Important Tasks (MIT) each day.
- Review system constantly for better ways to do things.
