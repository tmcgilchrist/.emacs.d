2 main options I can think of:

1. General wikipedia like database of plant information. Provide a community around it to maintain and add plant details.

2. Specialised application that provides more than just the raw information:
   -> View whole database of plant articles.
   -> Edit plant articles by adding text
   -> Edit plant articles by adding pictures

   -> Track popularity of plants used.
   -> Comments on how plants went in a design, what you could have improved on? 

   -> Provide custom lists of plants, eg plants for a particular client or 
   -> Suggest a plant, given a particular plant what other plants grow in the same conditions.
   -> Colour palette for planting?
      -> Boxes for the colours and clicking through gives you a number of popular plants.
      
   Applications:
   -> iPhone app that lets you view, edit and attach pictures.
   -> Website that stores all the data so it can be shared.
   -> Landscape Mockup Tools
   eg https://gomockingbird.com/
      http://cacoo.com/

      Allows you to create a simple outline of a design without getting bogged down in details. Kind of like something you'd sketch out on paper when exploring ideas. Being electronic you can share it, link to other pages about soil or plants etc, print it out etc.
