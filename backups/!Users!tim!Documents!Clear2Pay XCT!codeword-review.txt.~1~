CodeWordConstants.java
 - WLI_MESSAGE_DOMAIN should use WorkListConstants from OPF
 - DOMAIN and MESSAGE_DOMAIN define same value, just use DOMAIN and remove the other one.

CodeWordConditionInfo.java
 - addToCodeWordCheckInfoList() lazy initialization is unnecessary, just init the private list in the Constructor.
 - similar comment for CodeWordEnrichmentInfo and CodeWordInfo.
 - make codeWordConditionInfoList type safe using Java 5 style declaration.

StandardCodeWord.java
- codeWordInfoMap should use a thread safe version of HashMap, suggest ConcurrentHashMap with Java 5 typed declaration.
- EXCEPTION_HANDLER general pattern is define this as protected.
- line 144, is it necessary to add the order by to the query, it seems rather redundant.

StandardCodeWordContext
- getIssues there is a method on issues, toArray() which can replace the line
  return (GenericIssue[]) issues.toArray(new GenericIssue[issues.size()]);

StandardApprovalCodewordHandler
- use a thread safe version of HashMap like ConcurrentHashMap and use a Java 5 style type declaration.
- in configure() using map as element within the codeWordApprovalMap, use Java 5 type declaration and use ConcurrentHashMap.

StandardEnrichPaymentTransactionHandler
 - use thread safe version of HashMap
 - make EXCEPTION_HANDLER protected.
 - processCodeWord() method is too complicated and contains 13 levels of nesting. Please break it up into smaller methods and consider using a more efficient data structure to replace the for loops with a Map lookup.

StandardInformationalWorkListItemHandler
 - use thread safe version of HashMap
 - make EXCEPTION_HANDLER protected.

General:
 - Noticed that "-Do Nothing" is used in a number of Javadoc comments on constructors, it really isn't necessary.




Questions:
- using Java 5 type safe collections for XCT code?
- what about Java 5 style for loops?
- annotating methods that are implementing or overriding super class
- protecting configure methods with a private synchronised block? See CalculateTransactionSettlementDayHandler for an example.
