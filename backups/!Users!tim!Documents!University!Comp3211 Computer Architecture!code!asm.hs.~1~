-- Layout of final binary
-- Setup initial static values at the beginning of binary.
--       + constants
--       + plaintext string
--       + plaintext length
--       + space for cyphertext (at end of binary)
--       + lookup table

Grammar:

.text sections - places text in final binary at this location. Introduces constant variables.
.code - places final code at this location.

program -> block
block -> text-block | code-block
text-block -> text-stmt
text-stmt -> hex-symbol "\n"

code-block -> asm-stmt

asm-stm -> "xor" $rd "," $rs "," $rt                    -- Exclusive OR
         | "add" $rd "," $rs "," $rt                    -- Unsigned Addition
         | "bne" $rs "," $rt "," hex-symbol             -- Branch If Not Equal
         | "lw" $rs "," hex-symbol "(" $rt ")"          -- Load Word 
         | "sw" $rs "," hex-symbol "(" $rt ")"          -- Store Word

hex-symbol -> 0x([0-F]4)           -- "0x" followed by 1 - 4 Hex digits.
